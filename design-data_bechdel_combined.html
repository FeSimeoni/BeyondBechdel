            <p id="sourceText">“We reached out to more than a dozen women in film and television — writers, directors, actresses and producers — to ask what they think the next Bechdel Test should be. The answers we got ran the gamut. Some addressed representation behind the camera. Others zeroed in on the problems faced by women of color. Still others concentrated on characterization and story — how women are represented on screen. In the end, we boiled their responses down into 11 tests from our film-industry sources”</p>
